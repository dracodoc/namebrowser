\usage{
pkg_name_changed(startNew = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{startNew}{Default FALSE, compare user's environment with name table
shipped with this package, only update difference. If True, build from
scratch.}
}
\value{
list(pkg_to_add, pkg_to_remove)
}
\description{
Compare currently packages name with previous list \code{pkg_list}.
}
\details{
Use \code{.packages(all.available = TRUE)} to check folder under library
location path \code{lib.loc}. Faster than checking name and version both, but
has more false positives. It's recommended to use this only when scan
packages name and version both is too slow for you.
